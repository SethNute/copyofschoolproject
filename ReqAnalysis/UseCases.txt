Collaborative Music Player -  Fully Dressed Use-Case Model

We need 16 of these use cases..

Use Case 1.) Use Case Example
--------------------

	Primary Actor: Who is the main person interacting with the system in this use case
	
	Stakeholders and interests: Who are they and why are they interested
	
	Preconditions: State what must ALWAYS be true before the scenario can begin (ie: user is logged in)
	
	Success Guarantees: State what must ALWAYS be true at the end of the scenario (ie: receipt is printed)
	
	Main success scenario: List numbered steps from start to finish in best case success scenario, three kinds of steps
		- Interaction between actors
		- Validation (usually by system)
		- State change by the system

	Extensions: Look at each numbered step in the main success scenario and think of where this could branch out into either a failure or different type of success. Spell out each scenario in text
	
	Special requirements: Do any non-functional requirements relate specially to this use case? List them here if they exist
	
	Technology and data variation list: Basic technologies list. Ex: use a credit card scanner to scan cards
	
	Frequency of occurence: self explanatory
